Two Ruby Recursion Exercises

## **Fibonnaci**
The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

## **Merge Sort**
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.
