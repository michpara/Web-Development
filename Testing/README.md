# Testing Your Ruby Code

In this project, we added test to two previous ruby projects, **Caesar Cipher** and **Tic Tac Toe**. In addition, we created a new project **Connect Four** using **Test Driven Development**. 

# Connect Four

A basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal. This project was done using Test Driven Development, that is, the test cases were designed and implemented first.
